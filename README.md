# CatiaApi Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the CatiaApi repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing the capabilities of the CATIA v5 API using .NET C#. Whether you are new to CATIA or looking to leverage its power through code, this repository aims to provide you with a fundamental understanding of how to interact with CATIA v5 programmatically.

## What is CATIA?

**CATIA** (Computer-Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application) is a powerful and widely-used CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software suite developed by Dassault Syst√®mes. It is known for its extensive capabilities in product design, engineering, and manufacturing. CATIA is used across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, and more, to create complex 3D models, simulate product behavior, and facilitate collaboration throughout the product development lifecycle.
